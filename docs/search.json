    "text": "Plants are converting CO_2 into O_2 and glucose via light energy through photosynthesis. This process is decomposed into : first the light reaction converting light energy into chemical energy (ATP), then the dark reaction responsible for the assimilation of CO\\(_2\\) into glucose. We talk here about the first part which consist in a cascade of oxydo-reduction reaction called the photosynthetic electron transport chain (PETC).\nPhotons hitting the antennas attached to the membrane of the chloroplasts are absorbed and create a flow of electrons through the chain but a small portion of the energy is re-emitted through the chlorophyll fluorescence. It is possible to measure this fluorescence in response to light stimulation to probe the PETC and actually several locations in the PETC can be probed through this technique: the reactions centers (P700) and the various redox pools (plastocyanine PC, or ferredoxin Fd) visible on the figure below.\n\n\n\nThe photosynthetic electron transport chain (PETC) showing the flow of electrons from photosystem II (PSII) through the cytochrome b6f complex to photosystem I (PSI), with key components like plastocyanin (PC) and ferredoxin (Fd) indicated"
