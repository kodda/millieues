    "text": "Sonification of the PETC\nIt is possible to study such non-linear systems by sinewave stimulation and tracking harmonics in the response spectrum, higher harmonics being indicative of non-linearities in the system. Ladislav Nedbal in his talk at the DREAM workshop 2025 suggested, from visual inspection, that the waveform of the fluorescence he measured in response to oscillating light is similar to that of a saxophone.\n\n\n\nSlide extracted from Ladislav’s talk at the DREAM workshop 2025\n\n\nThis sounded interesting to me so I decided to listen to the timber of the PETC through sonification of the various signals recorded in the study of Yuxi Niu and al. (Niu et al. 2023) on Arabidopsis thaliana plants exposed to fluctuating light.\nFor each of the observables (Light, Chlorohyll Fluorescence, PC, Fd and P700), I collected the cleaned waveform where only the first 4 harmonics were kept at various frequencies. I then rescaled the timeseries to a 440Hz signal and added a Hanning window to give a simple dynamics envelope.\nYou can hear the result below. Except for the Light signal which is always a pure sine wave, the timber is quite different depending on the frequency…That’s how photosynthesis sounds!\n\n\n\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag. \n\nLight Signal\n\n\n\n\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag. \n\nChlorophyll Fluorescence\n\n\n\n\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag. \n\nPlastocyanin (PC)\n\n\n\n\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag. \n\nFerredoxin (Fd)\n\n\n\n\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag. \n\nP700 Reaction Center\n\n\n\nThe sound of photosynthesis at different frequencies\n\nReferences\n\n\nNiu, Yuxi, Dušan Lazár, Alfred R Holzwarth, David M Kramer, Shizue Matsubara, Fabio Fiorani, Hendrik Poorter, Silvia D Schrey, and Ladislav Nedbal. 2023. “Plants Cope with Fluctuating Light by Frequency-Dependent Nonphotochemical Quenching and Cyclic Electron Transport.” New Phytologist 239 (5): 1869–86."
